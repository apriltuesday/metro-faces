Metro maps X Photobios

Currently:
-cover faces (analogous to words) as in metro maps
-compute coverage w/ greedy algorithm
-weighted by frequency in dataset
-both binary 'bag of faces' + percentage of image taken up by face
-build coherence graph (nodes=short coh. paths, edges if overlap)

To do's:
-when choosing, use some measure of quality of image?
-weighting regions y/n?

-next is coherence - need to modify this notion
-e.g., no notion of wanting a small number of faces (core friends)
-e.g., no notion of time


Visualization -- making the map: [code from ezyang]
-first pass: stops just labeled with image name, click to reveal image
       -should be easy because this info is in JSON...
       -can hand-code some of this for proof of concept
-stops 'labeled' with images (or nodes ARE images)
-clicking on a stop brings up larger view of photo and maybe some metadata (faces etc)
-eventually: toggle between lines=events and lines=social circles
